Will Eccles' and Matt Chieco's final project for SER 210.

Matt doesn't have many commits, since his Android Studio refused to compile the native C++ (even with the NDK installed) for some reason or another. We instead worked together on Will's computer, hence he has all the major commits. We worked together at certain times in the cafeteria or between classes, so although he hasn't visibly done a lot of work, that's simply because he couldn't compile and run it to test it.
